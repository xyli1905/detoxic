# DeToxic
This is a class project in CMPS240 at UCSC, aiming to detect toxic content in Quora qestions. This project is from an on-going [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification), which provides us all the datasets and pretrained embeddings.

## Stage 1
### learning objectives
* Word2Vec
* basic RNN, LSTM, GRU

### coding objectives
* data preprocessing
	* input size(length)
	* augmentation?
* build baseline models
	* LSTM + dense
	* GRU + dense
	* try different embeddings
	* test their performance & get some intuition
* next step
	* encoder-decoder?
	* translation?
	* 2D Conv?

### timeline
* about 1 week (from 2019-01-28 to 2019-02-03)
